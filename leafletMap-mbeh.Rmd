# Install Packages

You might need to first install the `Tigris` package, which will be used to load Census shapefiles for NYC Counties.

```{r}
# install.packages("tigris")
```

# Setup: Import Packages

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
require(RColorBrewer)
require(rgdal)
require(leaflet)
require(leaflet.extras)
require(tigris)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)
```

# Load NYC County shapefiles (Polygons)

```{r}
# Define state & counties to focus on for this homework
state <- "New York"
county.names <- c("New York", "Kings", "Queens", "Bronx", "Richmond")

# Load & subset TIGER/Line shapefile data from Census Bureau
ny.counties.load <- counties(state, cb = TRUE)
ny.counties <- ny.counties.load[ny.counties.load$NAME %in% county.names,]

# Custom Palette for NYC County Polygons
factpal <- colorFactor(brewer.pal(n = 11, name ="Spectral"), county.names)
```
